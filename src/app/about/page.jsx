          We believe that our strength lies in our collaborative approach, which

            Agricomm was started out of the pain of losing seedlings due to luck of adequet information.
            Therefore our mission is to simplify the science of Agriculture.

          <p>
            At Agricomm, we’re more than just colleagues — we’re a family. This
            means we pay very little and expect people to work late. We want our
            employees to bring their whole selves to work. In return, we just
            ask that they keep themselves there until at least 5:00pm.
